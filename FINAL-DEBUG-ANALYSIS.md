# Final Debug Summary

## Issue Confirmed
The problem is **NOT** with our flake architecture. Both the original modular approach and this new clean plugin registry approach have the same issue:

**Nix + SSH + Private Repository = Empty flake.nix fetch**

## Root Cause
- Local: ✅ All architectures work perfectly 
- SSH Git clone: ✅ Works fine (we can clone and see complete files)
- Nix remote fetch via SSH: ❌ Returns empty/truncated flake.nix

## Evidence
- Error: 'syntax error, unexpected end of file at flake.nix:1:1'
- This means Nix is getting a completely empty file when fetching remotely
- The flake.nix exists and is valid (69 lines, proper syntax)
- Issue persists across different flake architectures

## Potential Solutions
1. **Nix SSH Agent**: Configure Nix to use SSH agent properly
2. **Git Credential Helper**: Set up Git credentials for Nix daemon  
3. **Alternative Distribution**: Package plugins differently (tarball, etc.)
4. **Local Development**: Focus on local usage until remote access is resolved

## Recommendation
The clean plugin architecture is excellent and ready. The SSH issue is a Nix/Git integration problem, not our code.
